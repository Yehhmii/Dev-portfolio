# Dev-portfolio
This project was an exciting and rewarding experience to build. I created my developer portfolio website from the ground up, learning and exploring new packages and tools along the way. The frontend is built with React, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend efficiently handles resume request functionality.
